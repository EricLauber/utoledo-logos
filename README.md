# University of Toledo Logos

## Background

I grew up in Toledo, Ohio and attended [The University of Toledo](https://www.utoledo.edu/) from 2006 to 2010, and again from 2015 - 2017. UT has strong involvement in the Toledo community. Prior to beginning my engineering degrees in 2006, UT's logo was a stylized version of the clock tower built into University Hall (U-Hall) - one of the oldest (1931) and most iconic buildings on campus.

In 2006, UT merged with what was then known as the Medical University of Ohio. As part of the merger, [UT developed a new seal and new logo](https://www.toledoblade.com/local/education/2006/08/05/UT-updates-its-seal-to-reflect-merger/stories/200608050040). Students were permitted to vote on one of three new logo options. Unfortunately, neither of these options included what I refer to as "the tower logo." I and many others voted for the most average and least obtrusive option, a basic shield. I felt this was disappointing, and since that time have been compelled to locate and preserve graphics files for other UT logos that I find more aesthetically appealing.

## The Files

For several years I would download copies of high quality `PNG` files as I came across them. More recently, I've found `EPS` files, providing all the benefits of vector graphics. I have not included `PNG` files if I have a vector equivalent.

Each time I find an `EPS`, I convert it to `SVG`. There are some cases where I only have found `SVG` copies and haven't bothered to convert back to `EPS`. There are also a few `PNG` files I have chosen to include when I found their design and ideas interesting. 

### Logo Types

Of the logos I like, I've included any logo variations that I can find, including those with color, those that are two-tone (often one color and white), and some others.

- **Tower** - these are the stylized logo that UT had during and before 2006. 
- **Athletic** - this Rocket logo is reserved for athletic marketing purposes only.

### Colors

Per UT's [brand guide](https://www.utoledo.edu/offices/marketing/brand-guide/guide.html), UT's primary colors are **Midnight Blue** and **Gold**.
